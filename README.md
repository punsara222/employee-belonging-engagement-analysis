## 📌 Problem Statement

Many organisations struggle with low employee engagement and turnover. This study investigates:

> *"Do employees who feel a stronger sense of belonging become more engaged?"*

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyse the relationship between employee belonging and engagement
- Identify patterns using **Descriptive Analysis**
- Determine statistical significance using **Inferential Analysis**
- Evaluate predictive power using **Predictive Analysis**

---

## 🧱 Feature Engineering

The dataset had no direct Belonging or Engagement column, so two composite scores were engineered:

| Feature | Formula | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `BelongingScore` | (RelationshipSatisfaction + EnvironmentSatisfaction) ÷ 2 | How included and valued an employee feels |
| `EngagementScore` | (JobInvolvement + JobSatisfaction) ÷ 2 | How dedicated and satisfied an employee is |

## 📈 Results Summary

### Descriptive Analysis
| Group | BelongingScore (mean) | EngagementScore (mean) |
|---|---|---|
| Stayed | 2.753 | 2.775 |
| Left | 2.532 | 2.494 |

### Inferential Analysis (Independent Samples t-test)
| Test | Statistic | p-value | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pearson Correlation (Belonging vs Engagement) | r = -0.0015 | p = 0.9531 | ✖ No individual-level relationship |
| t-test: BelongingScore (Stayed vs Left) | t = 4.06 | p = 0.0001 | ✔ Significant difference |
| t-test: EngagementScore (Stayed vs Left) | t = 6.17 | p < 0.001 | ✔ Significant difference |

### Predictive Analysis
| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | **86.1%** | **0.792** |
| Decision Tree | 85.0% | 0.754 |

Both `BelongingScore` and `EngagementScore` were significant **negative predictors** of attrition.

## ✅ Conclusion

The statement is **partially supported**:
- ✔ True at the **organisational level** — employees low on both scores are significantly more likely to leave
- ✖ Not true at the **individual level** — belonging does not directly predict engagement score-to-score
- Belonging and engagement appear to be two dimensions of the same underlying workplace wellbeing
